\title{Plot Training History from an Experiment}
\usage{
plotHistory(
  experiment,
  data,
  scope = "best",
  metrics = c("AUC", "Fit"),
  show_folds = FALSE,
  show_events = FALSE,
  main = "Training history",
  theme = "minimal"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{experiment}{An Experiment object (GpredomicsR).}

\item{data}{A Data object on which metrics are evaluated (training or external set).}

\item{scope}{Character; one of "best", "fbm", "top5", or "all". Controls which
individuals are aggregated at each generation. Default is "best".}

\item{metrics}{Character vector of metric names to plot. Must be columns of the
data.frame returned by \code{experiment$get_history()}. Typical choices include
c("AUC", "Fit", "Sensitivity", "Specificity", "F1", "MCC", "k").}

\item{show_folds}{Logical; if TRUE and if a "Fold" column is present, individual
fold curves are drawn in grey in the background. Default is FALSE.}

\item{show_events}{Logical; if TRUE and if the algorithm is GA, vertical lines
are drawn at GA event epochs (random sampling and forced diversity).}

\item{main}{Character; plot title. Default: "Training history".}

\item{theme}{Character; ggplot2 theme name: "minimal" (default), "bw", or "classic".}
}
\value{
A ggplot2 object.
}
\description{
This function computes and visualizes the training history directly from an
Experiment object by internally calling \code{experiment$get_history(data, scope)}.
}
\details{
It supports multiple scopes ("best", "fbm", "top5", "all"), cross-validation folds,
and optional vertical event lines corresponding to GA-specific epochs:
\itemize{
\item random sampling epochs (param$ga$randomsamplingepochs)
\item forced diversity epochs (param$ga$forceddiversityepochs)
}
}
