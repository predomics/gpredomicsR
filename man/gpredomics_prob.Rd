\title{Predict Probabilities from Gpredomics Model via Caret}
\usage{
gpredomics_prob(modelFit, newdata, preProc = NULL, submodels = NULL, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{modelFit}{Model object returned by gpredomics_train()}

\item{newdata}{New data for prediction (data.frame or matrix)}

\item{preProc}{Pre-processing object (currently not used)}

\item{submodels}{List of submodels (currently not used)}

\item{...}{Additional arguments (not used)}
}
\value{
Matrix with probability for each class (columns = class levels)
}
\description{
Returns probability matrix for caret compatibility using gpredomics scores.
The scores from predict()$score are converted to pseudo-probabilities:
\itemize{
\item Score represents the model's confidence (higher score = more confident in class 1)
\item Scores are normalized to range 0 to 1 to act as probabilities
}
}
