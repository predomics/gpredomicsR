Description: This package is part of the predomics suite and provides analytical 
  extensions to the gpredomics package, which is implemented in Rust. 
  It enables seamless integration of genetic algorithm-based predictive modeling in R, 
  offering functions for handling populations of models, extracting and analyzing model attributes, 
  and visualizing evolutionary trends. By bridging Rust’s computational efficiency 
  with R’s analytical capabilities, this package enhances model interpretability, 
  selection, and evaluation, making it a powerful tool for high-performance genetic prediction workflows.
